# NeuroLint Pro HTML Entity Fix

## Issue

Your code sample contains HTML entities that aren't being fixed because the current NeuroLint Pro engine only handles a basic set of HTML entities:

**Currently supported:**

- `&quot;` → `"`
- `&amp;` → `&`
- `&lt;` → `<`
- `&gt;` → `>`

**Missing from your sample:**

- `&copy;` → `©`
- `&ndash;` → `–`
- `&#36;` → `$`
- `&amp;#36;` → `$`
- `&sect;` → `§`
- `&para;` → `¶`
- `&bull;` → `•`
- `&deg;` → `°`
- `&trade;` → `™`

## Solution Applied

I've updated the following files to include comprehensive HTML entity support:

### 1. `/fix-layer-2-patterns.js`

✅ **UPDATED** - Added all missing HTML entity patterns

### 2. `/neurolint-pro.js` (needs manual update)

**Lines 1242-1248:** Replace the entityPatterns array with:

```javascript
// Layer 2: Entity and pattern issues
const entityPatterns = [
  { pattern: /&quot;/g, name: "HTML quote entities" },
  { pattern: /&amp;/g, name: "HTML ampersand entities" },
  { pattern: /&lt;|&gt;/g, name: "HTML bracket entities" },
  { pattern: /&copy;/g, name: "HTML copyright entities" },
  { pattern: /&ndash;|&mdash;/g, name: "HTML dash entities" },
  { pattern: /&#36;|&amp;#36;/g, name: "HTML dollar sign entities" },
  { pattern: /&nbsp;/g, name: "HTML non-breaking space entities" },
  {
    pattern: /&sect;|&para;|&bull;|&deg;|&trade;/g,
    name: "HTML special character entities",
  },
  { pattern: /console\.log\(/g, name: "Console.log usage" },
  { pattern: /\bvar\s+/g, name: "Var declarations" },
];
```

**Lines 807-826:** Replace the HTML entity fixes with:

```javascript
// Fix HTML entities - COMPREHENSIVE SET
const htmlEntityFixes = [
  { from: /&quot;/g, to: '"', name: "&quot; to quotes" },
  { from: /&amp;/g, to: "&", name: "&amp; to ampersand" },
  { from: /&lt;/g, to: "<", name: "&lt; to less-than" },
  { from: /&gt;/g, to: ">", name: "&gt; to greater-than" },
  { from: /&copy;/g, to: "©", name: "&copy; to copyright" },
  { from: /&ndash;/g, to: "–", name: "&ndash; to en-dash" },
  { from: /&mdash;/g, to: "—", name: "&mdash; to em-dash" },
  { from: /&#36;/g, to: "$", name: "&#36; to dollar-sign" },
  { from: /&amp;#36;/g, to: "$", name: "&amp;#36; to dollar-sign" },
  { from: /&nbsp;/g, to: " ", name: "&nbsp; to space" },
  { from: /&sect;/g, to: "§", name: "&sect; to section-sign" },
  { from: /&para;/g, to: "¶", name: "&para; to paragraph-sign" },
  { from: /&bull;/g, to: "•", name: "&bull; to bullet" },
  { from: /&deg;/g, to: "°", name: "&deg; to degree-sign" },
  { from: /&trade;/g, to: "™", name: "&trade; to trademark" },
];

htmlEntityFixes.forEach(({ from, to, name }) => {
  if (transformedCode.match(from)) {
    transformedCode = transformedCode.replace(from, to);
    appliedFixes.push(`HTML Entity: Converted ${name}`);
    console.log(`🛠️  [FALLBACK] Fixed HTML entities: ${name}`);
  }
});
```

## Expected Result

After applying this fix, your code sample:

```javascript
Hello &amp; Welcome!
This is a &quot;test&quot; component with &lt;HTML&gt; entities.
Price: &amp;#36;99.99 €85.50
Copyright &copy; 2024 &ndash; All rights reserved.
Special chars: &sect; &para; &bull; &deg; &trade;
```

Should be fixed to:

```javascript
Hello & Welcome!
This is a "test" component with <HTML> entities.
Price: $99.99 €85.50
Copyright © 2024 – All rights reserved.
Special chars: § ¶ • ° ™
```

## Testing

Try the dashboard paste feature again with your sample code - it should now properly fix all HTML entities.
